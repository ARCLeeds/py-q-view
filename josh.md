Hello Josh

As discussed on Friday there are a number of features left to implement in the PyQview application.

1. Contact page that allows the user to send e mail to us to report bugs in the page. There is already a function to send email to users when they register.

2.  The modules page needs to be completed. When I use the method that I use to get the queue information there is nothing returned from the module list command.  Therefore if you try to implement this it may be a good idea to ask Martin if there is a file where the details on a users currently loaded modules are stored or if there is a way to force the module list command to output inforamtion

3. The info page. I planned on putting links here to the arc and polaris page, The uni vpn page, links to mobaXterm and other tools that may be useful to arc users.

4. A general check over to see if you can find a neater or quicker way to do things would also be much appreciated. Its always nice to know if there is a better way
